## Getting Started

Welcome to Bubble Sort.

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two main folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies (of which there are currently none)

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.

> If you want to customize the folder structure, open `.vscode/settings.json` and update the related settings there.

## How to run

You can run this program in VSCode or through the terminal when in the src/BubbleSort directory by running `javac Main.java` and `java Main`.

## How to view documentation

You can generate javadocs to view the documentation of this project in a professional fashion by navigating to the currently empty docs directory in your terminal.  Once there, run `javadoc ../src/BubbleSort/Main.java` to generate javadocs in the empty docs directory.  From there open the generated `index.html` file in the web browser of your choice.
